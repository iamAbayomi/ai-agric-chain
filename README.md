# AI AGRIC CHAIN

## Blockchain for Agricultural Supply Chain Transparency
### Overview
This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to enhance transparency and traceability in the agricultural supply chain. By implementing blockchain and smart contract solutions, the goal is to ensure authenticity, quality assurance, and ethical sourcing of agricultural products.

### Features
- Product Identification: Assign unique digital identities (e.g., QR codes, RFID tags) to each agricultural product during its initial production phase.

- Data Logging with AI: Utilize AI algorithms to collect and analyze data at various stages of the supply chain, including cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and processing.

- Blockchain Records: Record relevant information on a decentralized blockchain at each step, creating an immutable and transparent ledger.

- Smart Contracts for Compliance: Implement smart contracts to automatically enforce compliance with predefined standards and regulations, ensuring ethical practices.

- Traceability for Consumers: Enable consumers to trace the entire journey of the purchased product, providing information about its origin, transportation, and certifications.

- Real-time Monitoring: Utilize AI algorithms for real-time monitoring of the supply chain, detecting anomalies and deviations for prompt corrective actions.
